Minimum Bottleneck Spanning Tree:
Kruscal

All-pairs vertexes' Minimum Bottleneck Path:
DP in the Kruscal's MST
O(n^2)*O(1)

Minimum Diameter Spanning Tree:
Kariv-Hakimi Algorithm

Directed MST:
Chuâ€“Liu/Edmonds' Algorithm

Second-best MST:
get All-pairs vertexes' Minimum Bottleneck Path, then enumerate all no-tree-edges to replace the longest edge between two vertexes to get a worse MST

Degree-constrained MST:
TODO
remove the vertex from the whole graph,then add edges to increase degress
need All-pairs vertexes' Minimum Bottleneck Path, too

Binary search

Manhattan MST:
