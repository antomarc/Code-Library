find the (x,y)pair that x^2-n*y^2=1
these is not solution if and only if n is a square number.

solution:
simply brute-force search the integer y, get (x1,y1). ( O(sqrt(n)) )
or we can enumerate the continued fraction of sqrt(n), as (x/y), it will be much more faster

other solution pairs' matrix:
[ x1 n*y1 ]
[ y1 x1   ]
k-th solution is pow({matrix},k)
